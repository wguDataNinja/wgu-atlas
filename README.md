# WGU Atlas

**Explore courses, programs, catalog changes, and student discussion**

WGU Atlas is a public-facing reference and explorer built from the validated WGU public catalog archive. It tracks course and program history across 108 catalog editions spanning 2017 through 2026, with a timeline of major catalog events and (planned) student discussion context layered on top.

*Created by WGU-DataNinja*

## Authoritative Project Docs

Internal project authority and current execution state are tracked in:
- `_internal/ATLAS_CONTROL.md` (current execution control)
- `_internal/ATLAS_REPO_MEMORY.md` (stable architecture/runtime facts and durable decisions)
- `_internal/DEV_LOG.md` (session ledger / recent changes)
- `_internal/project_overview/01_SITE_DESIGN_SPEC.md` (current product/scope grounding spec)

If there is conflict between older docs and current state, use those three in that order.

## Current Status (2026-04-08)

Active branch: `homepage-redesign` — UI polish in progress. `main` is the stable deployed baseline.

**Pages polished (this branch):**
- `/compare` — compact result header with degree names, improved column stats, per-term course counts, filter bug fix
- `/courses/[code]` — section reordered (description first), degree list capped with expand, internal data notes removed
- `/programs/[code]` — course roster promoted above curriculum detail, internal provenance labels removed

**Still to-do:**
- Homepage (`/`) — design TBD; planned to feature screenshots/previews of polished pages
- About page
- Course explorer, degree explorer, colleges pages

## What's here

| Section | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Course explorer** | Browse and filter all 1,646 courses (active, retired, and certificate) |
| **Course pages** | Per-course history: all observed titles, program memberships, and edition coverage |
| **Timeline** | Chronological view of major catalog events — school reorganizations, mass course changes, program additions |
| **Data** | Download the canonical course and event datasets |
| **Methods** | How the data was collected, validated, and interpreted |

## Data provenance

All catalog data is derived from the official WGU public course catalog, scraped and parsed across 108 editions (2017-01 through 2026-03). Three editions are missing from the archive (2017-02, 2017-04, 2017-06).

The underlying archive and parser live in a separate internal research repository. This repo contains only the pre-generated site-ready data artifacts.

Key facts about the current data layer:
- **838** active AP course codes (2026-03 baseline)
- **52** active certificate codes
- **114** program body blocks
- **1,646** total course codes (active + retired + cert)
- **41** named catalog events

---

## Data separation policy

WGU Atlas maintains a hard boundary between:

- **Official catalog facts** — what appears in the public WGU catalog
- **Discussion signals** — Reddit and community data (planned feature layer)
- **LLM-generated content** — clearly labeled where used

These are never mixed in the same data field or presented without attribution.

---

## Development workflow

Active UI work happens on the `homepage-redesign` branch. `main` is the stable/deployed baseline.

To iterate on the UI locally:

```bash
# Start dev server (port 3099)
npm run dev -- --port 3099 > /tmp/atlas-dev.log 2>&1 &

# Capture a screenshot (after ~8s startup)
npx playwright screenshot --browser chromium "http://localhost:3099/wgu-atlas/" /tmp/atlas-homepage.png

# Interactive compare page screenshot (uses Playwright scripting)
# See memory/project_playwright_selection.md for the full script + nth(1) selector trick
```

The site uses `basePath: "/wgu-atlas"` in `next.config.ts` — all local routes are prefixed. Key routes: `/wgu-atlas/` (home), `/wgu-atlas/compare`, `/wgu-atlas/programs/BSCS`.

## Course code confidence

### What we did

- **108 catalog editions** scraped and parsed (2017-01 through 2026-03), covering every program roster across that span
- **Cross-referenced two independent sources:** the edition history and the 2026-03 catalog snapshot; any code missing from the snapshot is flagged retired rather than silently dropped
- **Internal consistency check:** every course code appearing in active program rosters (`program_enriched.json`, scraped from catalog program pages) is present in `canonical_courses.csv` — zero gaps found
- **Per-code trust signals** computed and stored: `ghost_flag`, `single_appearance_flag`, `stability_class`, `current_title_confidence`, `title_variant_class` — each row carries its own confidence indicator rather than a single dataset-wide claim
- **Known truncation and extraction artifacts** manually identified and overridden for affected codes

### Honest assessment

This dataset is **comprehensive for what the scraper saw** but cannot guarantee it saw everything. Structural blind spots remain:

- **Certificate codes only tracked from 2024-09 forward** — cert courses that existed earlier or under different structures may not appear
- **Courses not in any program roster** — if a course exists only as a standalone page the scraper never visited, it would be absent from the entire universe
- **Post-2026-03 additions** — nothing added after the last scrape run is present
- **No independent external cross-check** — there is no WGU API or authoritative public course list to validate against

### Human review path

The most practical completeness check is section-by-section human review. As course codes surface from student discussion or other sources, they can be spot-checked against the dataset:

| What to check | How |
|---|---|
| Is a code in the dataset at all? | Search `canonical_courses.csv` or `canonical_courses.json` by `course_code` |
| Is it marked active? | `active_current = True` and `stability_class` not `single` or `ghost_flag = False` |
| Does the title look right? | Compare `canonical_title_current` against what students actually call it |
| Is it flagged uncertain? | `current_title_confidence = low` or `title_variant_class = unresolved` means manual review was deferred |

Any code that appears in student posts but is absent from the dataset is a genuine discovery worth adding. Over time, community-sourced codes are the most reliable signal for catching what the scraper missed.
